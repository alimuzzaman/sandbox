# Remote Job Runtime Implementation Evidence

This file records commands actually observed during implementation. It must not contain
secrets, credential-bearing SSH targets, or unredacted project output.

## Phase 1: composition boundaries

- Date: 2026-07-18
- Command: `.cli-venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_architecture_boundaries tests.test_command_composition tests.test_mcp_composition -v`
- Result: PASS, 27 tests in 0.812 seconds.
- Evidence: new application, jobs, transports, CI, CLI module, and MCP group boundaries
  are explicitly manifested; exact CLI inventory remains 70 commands; exact MCP
  inventory is 20 groups and 83 uniquely owned tools; no new compatibility-facade or
  wildcard consumers were introduced.
