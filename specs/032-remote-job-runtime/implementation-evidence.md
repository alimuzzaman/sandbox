# Remote Job Runtime Implementation Evidence

This file records commands actually observed during implementation. It must not contain
secrets, credential-bearing SSH targets, or unredacted project output.

## Phase 1: composition boundaries

- Date: 2026-07-18
- Command: `.cli-venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_architecture_boundaries tests.test_command_composition tests.test_mcp_composition -v`
- Result: PASS, 27 tests in 0.812 seconds.
- Evidence: new application, jobs, transports, CI, CLI module, and MCP group boundaries
  are explicitly manifested; exact CLI inventory remains 70 commands; exact MCP
  inventory is 20 groups and 83 uniquely owned tools; no new compatibility-facade or
  wildcard consumers were introduced.

## Phase 2: durable foundation

- Date: 2026-07-18
- Command: `.cli-venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_job_models tests.test_job_registry tests.test_runtime_config tests.test_target_resolution tests.test_job_process_identity tests.test_job_contracts tests.test_config_descriptors tests.test_project_config tests.test_runtime_contracts tests.test_runtime_adapters tests.test_architecture_boundaries tests.test_mcp_composition -v`
- Result: PASS, 76 tests in 0.686 seconds.
- Command: `mcp/wp-server/.venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_server_transport -v`
- Result: PASS, 5 tests in 0.001 seconds.
- Repository fixture evidence: schema version 1, `journal_mode=wal`, foreign keys enabled,
  atomic first-submit/replay behavior (`False`, then `True`), and tables for jobs,
  process identities, heartbeats, leases, output streams/events, metrics, artifacts,
  and compatibility differences.
