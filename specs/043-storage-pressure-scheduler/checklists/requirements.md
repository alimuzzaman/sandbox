# Specification Quality Checklist: Scheduled storage-pressure monitor and safe-tier reaper

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Primary, negative, and boundary scenarios are covered
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies, compatibility constraints, and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Iteration 1 removed named commands and unit-file terminology from requirement text; the
  schedule is described by what it renders and what confirmation it demands, not by the
  init system that runs it. The init facility appears only in Assumptions.
- Thresholds are stated as free-space shares (15% / 5%) rather than absolute sizes, matching
  the previous feature's contract.
