# Specification Quality Checklist: Controller Auto-Update

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Primary, negative, and boundary scenarios are covered
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies, compatibility constraints, and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Fast-forward, upstream branch, GitHub origin and a lock are named because the owner's approved design (2026-11-10) fixes them as trust constraints, not as implementation choices; they are kept at the level of observable behavior.
- `speckit-refine` and its PRD review were skipped: the owner approved the design directly and asked for `speckit-specify` first.
